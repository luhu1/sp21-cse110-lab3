                <p> Today I spent a lot of time trying to organize my schedule and all
                    the task I have to do in my adgenda for all my classes and for my career.
                    after I finish setting up my agenda, I got stressed by the sheer amount of
                    workload that I have everyday. I also got stressed because of the upcoming
                    deadlines for programs that I am applying for which requires a Statement of 
                    Purpose and Letters of Rec. I feel like as a junior I really want to have an 
                    easy year but due to <strong>COVID-19</strong> and upperdivision classes, I don't think that
                    this quarter will be one. </p>

                <p>Today was a very eventful day. I woke up before my alarm rang around 9:00. It was a very calming day.
                    I went outside in the patio and took in some vitamin D by soaking in the sun. Today there was no class
                    so I had some free time to go. Overall, it was a slow paced and relaxing day. I hope that there will be
                    more days similar to this in the upcoming future.

                <p> Today was a very productive day. I did all my homework and worked on all my assignements.
                    But one sad thing was that since I dont have a car I was stuck at home and everyone of my apartment mates 
                    were out having fun.All of them went on very sponatneous trips up to LA from SD with their significant other 
                    while I was working and taking classes at home. I felt very sad and lonely. But I ended up getting free time and
                    decided bake some cookies for myself. Overall, I felt like today we a very hardworking day.
